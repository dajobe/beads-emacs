# AI Agent Instructions

## Project checks

- Target Emacs 29.1 or newer and use lexical binding in every Emacs Lisp file.
- Keep every package symbol under the `beads-` prefix, except the intentional
  short `bv` command alias for `beads`.
- Pass `br` and `bv` arguments directly to `process-file` or `make-process`;
  never construct a shell command or edit Beads data files directly.
- Run `make check` and `git diff --check` after code changes. Run `make clean`
  before committing so byte-compiled files remain build artifacts.
- Run `format-markdown FILE...` after editing Markdown.
- Keep commit messages professional and in the past tense. Include a summary, an
  explanatory body, and concrete `*` bullets; name modified functions in
  relevant bullets.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses a Beads tracker—either the Go `bd` CLI or the Rust `br`
CLI—for issue tracking, plus
[beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) (`bv`) for
graph-aware triage. Issues are stored in `.beads/`. `bv` auto-discovers
supported JSONL exports, including `.beads/issues.jsonl` and legacy
`.beads/beads.jsonl`.

**Choose the tracker CLI from this repository's instructions and
configuration.** Use `bd` commands in a Go Beads workspace and `br` commands in
a beads_rust workspace. Do not run both trackers against the same workspace or
infer the tracker solely from the JSONL filename.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects. Instead of parsing
.beads/issues.jsonl / .beads/beads.jsonl directly or hallucinating graph
traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with
precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS,
eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning).
The selected tracker CLI (`bd` or `br`) handles creating, claiming, modifying,
and closing beads.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY --robot-* flags. Bare bv launches an interactive TUI that
blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** Its `triage` object
contains:

- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

# TOON output (--format toon): a compact tabular encoding. Measured on this
# repository it is 7% smaller than JSON for --robot-graph but 9-15% LARGER for
# nested payloads (--robot-triage, --robot-plan, --robot-insights,
# --robot-label-health); use --stats to see both sizes before adopting it.
bv --robot-graph --format toon
bv --robot-triage --format toon --stats
```

Recommendations can include blocked or assigned work;
`triage.quick_ref.top_picks` reflects snapshot readiness. A suggested action
records its original local ID, working directory, and tracker route. Use that
route rather than a namespaced display ID or an unrelated current directory.
Inspect current tracker state before execution: analysis does not reserve work
or guarantee that a later claim succeeds.

#### Other bv Commands

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |

Every robot command emits one JSON object; with `--graph-format=dot` or
`mermaid` the diagram text is the `graph` field (`bv --robot-graph
--graph-format=dot | jq -r .graph`), not the whole output.

#### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
```

### Tracker Commands for Issue Management

Use exactly one command family, matching the tracker configured for the
repository.

#### Rust beads_rust (`br`)

```bash
br ready --json                       # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open --json          # All open issues
br show <id> --json                   # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2 --json
br update <id> --claim --json         # Claim for the current actor and start work
br close <id> --reason="Completed" --json
br close <id1> <id2> --reason="Completed" --json
br sync --flush-only                  # Export DB to JSONL after Beads mutations
```

#### Go Beads (`bd`)

```bash
bd ready --json                       # Show issues ready to work
bd show <id> --json                   # Full issue details
bd create "..." -t task -p 2 --json
bd update <id> --claim --json         # Atomically claim work
bd close <id> --json
bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>
bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl        # Refresh the compatibility export read by bv
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Triage**: Run `bv --robot-triage` to find the highest-impact actionable
   work
2. **Verify**: Check the selected tracker's `show`/`ready` output before
   claiming
3. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --claim --json` or `bd update <id> --claim
   --json`
4. **Work**: Implement the task
5. **Complete**: Use the selected tracker's `close` command
6. **Refresh for bv**: Run `br sync --flush-only` or the `bd export` command
   above so the JSONL export is current

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready --json` and `bd
  ready --json` show unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers
  0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: Use `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` or `bd dep add <issue>
  <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Git Policy

Tracker commands do not grant permission to commit or push application code.
Follow this repository's own git and tracker instructions before staging,
committing, syncing, or pushing. If the repository says "commit only when
asked," that rule overrides any generic workflow advice.
